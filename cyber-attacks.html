              In computers and computer networks, an attack is any attempt to
              expose, alter, disable, destroy, steal or gain information through
              unauthorized access to or make unauthorized use of an asset. A
              cyberattack is any offensive maneuver that targets computer
              information systems, infrastructures, computer networks, or
              personal computer devices.

              An attacker is a person or process that attempts to access data,
              functions, or other restricted areas of the system without
              authorization, potentially with malicious intent. Depending on the
              context, cyberattacks can be part of cyberwarfare or
              cyberterrorism. A cyberattack can be employed by sovereign states,
              individuals, groups, society, or organizations, and it may
              originate from an anonymous source. A product that facilitates a
              cyberattack is sometimes called a cyberweapon.

                A cyber attack is a deliberate exploitation of your systems
                and/or network. Cyber attacks use malicious code to compromise
                your computer, logic or data and steal, leak or hold your data
                hostage. Cyber attack prevention is essential for every business
                and organisation.
                <br /><br />

                  Multi-factor authentication (MFA; encompassing Two-factor
                  authentication or 2FA, along with similar terms) is an
                  electronic authentication method in which a user is granted
                  access to a website or application only after successfully
                  presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an
                  authentication mechanism: knowledge (something only the user
                  knows), possession (something only the user has), and
                  inherence (something only the user is).<br /><br />
                  MFA protects the user from an unknown person trying to access
                  their data such as personal ID details or financial assets.

                  One of the most common ways cyber criminals get access to your
                  data is through your employees. They’ll send fraudulent emails
                  impersonating someone in your organisation and will either ask
                  for personal details or for access to certain files. Links
                  often seem legitimate to an untrained eye and it’s easy to
                  fall into the trap. This is why employee awareness is vital
                  <br /><br />One of the most efficient ways to protect against
                  cyber attacks and all types of data breaches is to train your
                  employees on cyber attack prevention and inform them of
                  current cyber attacks.

                  Often cyber attacks happen because your systems or software
                  aren’t fully up to date, leaving weaknesses. Hackers exploit
                  these weaknesses so cybercriminals exploit these weaknesses to
                  gain access to your network. Once they are in – it’s often too
                  late to take preventative action. <br /><br />
                  To counteract this, it’s smart to invest in a patch management
                  system that will manage all software and system updates,
                  keeping your system resilient and up to date. Leaf offer patch
                  management as part of their managed security solution.

                  There are so many different types of sophisticated data
                  breaches and new ones surface every day and even make
                  comebacks. Putting your network behind a firewall is one of
                  the most effective ways to defend yourself from any cyber
                  attack. <br /><br />
                  A firewall system will block any brute force attacks made on
                  your network and/or systems before it can do any damage,
                  something we can help you with.

                  Believe it or not, one of the attacks that you can receive on
                  your systems can be physical, having control over who can
                  access your network is really really important. Somebody can
                  simply walk into your office or enterprise and plug in a USB
                  key containing infected files into one of your computers
                  allowing them access to your entire network or infect it.
                  <br /><br />
                  It’s essential to control who has access to your computers.
                  Having a perimeter security system installed is a very good
                  way to stop cybercrime as much as break ins!

                  Who doesn’t have a wifi enabled device in 2020? And that’s
                  exactly the danger, any device can get infected by connecting
                  to a network, if this infected device then connects to your
                  business network your entire system is at serious risk.

                  Securing your wifi networks and hiding them is one of the
                  safest things you can do for you systems. With developing more

                  <br /><br />
                  Having separate logins for each staff member will help you
                  reduce the number of attack fronts. Users only log in once

                  Having the same password setup for everything can be

                  have access to everything in your system and any application

                  <br /><br />
                  Having different passwords setup for every application you use
                  is a real benefit to your security, and changing them often

                  A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network
                  across a public network and enables users to send and receive
                  data across shared or public networks as if their computing
                  devices were directly connected to the private network.
                  Applications running across a VPN may therefore benefit from
                  the functionality, security, and management of the private
                  network.<br /><br />
                  It provides access to resources that may be inaccessible on
                  the public network, and is typically used for telecommuting
                  workers. Encryption is a common, although not an inherent,
                  part of a VPN connection.
